em is a relative unit in CSS.

It is based on the font size of the element it's used in.

So:

ini
Copy
Edit
1em = font-size of the current element
üî∏ What Happens When You Use padding in em?
When you set padding in em, the actual padding space will scale with the font size.

Example:
css
Copy
Edit
.box {
  font-size: 20px;
  padding: 1em; /* = 20px of padding */
}
If you change the font size, the padding automatically grows or shrinks with it.

This makes em super handy for scalable, responsive designs.

üß† Why Use em for Padding?
It's great for accessibility ‚Äî when users increase text size, spacing increases too.

Keeps spacing proportional to text, which often looks more natural.

Perfect for components like buttons, inputs, or cards where the padding should match the text size.

‚ö†Ô∏è Gotchas
If you're nesting elements, remember: em is relative to the current element's font-size, not always the root.

Can lead to compounding if you're not careful:

css
Copy
Edit
.parent {
  font-size: 20px;
}

.child {
  font-size: 1.2em;  /* = 24px (1.2 * 20px) */
  padding: 1em;       /* = 24px */
}
