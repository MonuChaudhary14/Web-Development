In CSS, position is a property used to control the layout and placement of elements. Two of the values you mentioned â€” static and relative â€” are part of the position property.

ðŸ”¹ position: static;
This is the default position value for all HTML elements.

Elements with position: static are placed in the normal document flow.

They are not affected by top, right, bottom, or left properties.

You canâ€™t move them with those offset properties.

Example:

div {
  position: static;
  top: 10px; /* This will have no effect */
}
ðŸ”¹ position: relative;
This positions the element relative to its normal position.

The element still takes up space in the normal flow.

But you can use top, left, right, or bottom to nudge it from where it would have been.

This doesnâ€™t affect the position of other elements.

Example:

div {
  position: relative;
  top: 10px;   /* Moves the element 10px down */
  left: 20px;  /* Moves it 20px to the right */
}

position: absolute;
This positions the element relative to the nearest positioned ancestor (i.e., the closest parent with a position other than static).

If no such ancestor exists, it will be positioned relative to the <html> (or the initial containing block) â€” basically the entire page.

The element is removed from the normal document flow.

It does not affect other elements, and other elements ignore it.

You can use top, right, bottom, and left to place it exactly where you want
