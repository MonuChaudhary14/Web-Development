        // Synchronous code-> 
        // Synchronous code runs step-by-step, in the exact order it appears. Each operation must finish before the next one starts


        // Asynchronous code
        // Asynchronous code allows JavaScript to continue running other tasks without waiting for a slow operation (like network request, file read, or timer) to finish.

        /*
        Why Use Async?
        JavaScript runs on a single thread.

        Without async, slow tasks freeze the page.

        Async ensures a smooth, responsive UI.
        */


        // Blocking 
        /*
        Blocking refers to code execution that prevents further code from running until the current task is completely finished.

        Since JavaScript is single-threaded (it runs one task at a time), any long-running or blocking operation will pause everything else, including:

        Rendering the page

        Responding to user input

        Handling animations or other events
        */

        // Event Loop
        /*
        The Event Loop is the core mechanism that allows JavaScript to handle asynchronous operations while remaining single-threaded.

        It enables non-blocking behavior, so tasks like fetching data, reading files, or waiting for a timer don't freeze the main thread.



        How It Works
        Call Stack

        Where function calls are made and executed.

        It's synchronous (runs one task at a time).

        Web APIs / Node APIs

        Browser or Node.js handles things like timers, HTTP requests, DOM events.

        Callback Queue (Task Queue)

        When Web APIs finish (like a setTimeout), they push callbacks here.

        Event Loop

        Constantly checks if the call stack is empty.

        If yes, it moves a task from the queue into the stack and runs it.
