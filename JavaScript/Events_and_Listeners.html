 In JavaScript, an event is an action or occurrence that happens in the browser that the JavaScript code can respond to. Events can be triggered by users (like clicking a button or pressing a key), the browser (like a page loading or resizing), or programmatically. */

        /*
        1.Capturing Phase (a.k.a. Capture phase)
        2.Target Phase
        3.Bubbling Phase

        Capturing Phase:
        In the capturing phase, the event starts from the root of the DOM tree (document) and travels down toward the target element. You can think of it as ‚Äúfrom parent to child.‚Äù

        By default, JavaScript event listeners are triggered during the bubbling phase, but you can specifically tell the browser to listen during the capturing phase.



        2. Target Phase
        The event has reached the actual element that was clicked (or triggered).

        Event listeners on the target element are invoked regardless of capture/bubble, depending on how they're registered.



        3. Bubbling Phase
        After hitting the target, the event bubbles back up the DOM from the target to the root.

        This is the default behavior for addEventListener.

        */


        // By default, the event listener is applied to the bubbling phase

        fpara.addEventListener('click', changeText, true);  // This will mark the useCapture value to true due to which the Listener is applied to the Capture phase




        // Event Object
        /*
        When an event (like a click, submit, keydown, etc.) occurs in JavaScript, the browser automatically creates an event object and passes it to the event handler.

        This event object contains detailed information about the event, such as:

        What type of event it was (click, keydown, etc.)

        Which element triggered it

        Mouse position (for mouse events)

        Key pressed (for keyboard events)

        Methods to stop propagation or prevent default behavior


        The listener function gets the event and we can print it and use it anywhere


        */

        let div = document.getElementById("div");

        div.addEventListener('click' , change);



        /*
        In the browser, many HTML elements have built-in (default) behaviors that are triggered by user actions ‚Äî like clicks or keypresses.

        These are called default actions.

            // It's especially useful when:

            // You have one event listener for multiple elements.

            // You want to handle events dynamically



        }

        for(let i = 0; i < paras.length; i++){

            //     alert("You have clicked on para "+i);
            // });

            para.addEventListener('click', addalert);
        }

        let divpara = document.getElementById('wrapper');
        
        divpara.addEventListener('click', addalert);

            üß± What is DOMContentLoaded in JavaScript?
            DOMContentLoaded is a browser event that fires when the initial HTML document is completely loaded and parsed, without waiting for stylesheets, images, and subframes to finish loading.

            ‚úÖ Why use it?
            JavaScript code often interacts with DOM elements. If you try to access or modify DOM elements before they‚Äôre fully loaded, you'll get errors like null or undefined.

            Using DOMContentLoaded ensures the DOM is ready for JavaScript to safely run.

            ‚úÖ Syntax
            */
            document.addEventListener("DOMContentLoaded", function () {
            // Your code here runs AFTER the HTML is fully loaded
            console.log("DOM is fully loaded");
            });
