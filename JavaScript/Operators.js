Copy
Edit
console.log(window.name); // usually an empty string unless explicitly set
So when you write:


let name = "John";
You're shadowing the global window.name property. Many linters or browser dev tools (like Chrome DevTools or VS Code) will show a warning like:

"'name' is a deprecated alias" or "Avoid using 'name' as a variable â€” it's a global property".*/
