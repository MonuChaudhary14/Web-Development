DNS server->
It converts the URL into the IP address which is known as domain name resolution


Domain Name Resolution is the process of converting a domain name (like example.com) into an IP address (like 93.184.216.34) that computers use to identify each other on a network

A DNS server (Domain Name System server) is like the phonebook of the internet. It helps computers find the IP address for a website name (domain) so they can connect to it.

When you type something like www.google.com into your browser:

Your computer sends a request to a DNS server.

The DNS server checks if it knows the IP address for that domain.

If it knows, it sends back the IP (like 142.250.190.4), and your browser connects to that address.

If it doesnâ€™t know, it asks other DNS servers until it finds the answer.
