When a client sends a request to the server then there are multiple processes which are-

1.ISP(Internet Service Provider)-
First the request is send to the ISP then the ISP access the Internet
ISP provides the IP to the device


Packets->
When we are sending a file , the file is divided into multiple chunks
these chunks are known as Packets


Protocol-> 
It is the set of rules 
HTTP
FTP
SMTP
Gmail-> SMTP


TCP-> It tells the port number. It defines that on which application of the computer we have to interact

Request -> application + TCP + IP + Hardware  


Browser(request) -> Domain Name Resolution -> DNS -> IP Address -> Local ISP -> Regional ISP -> NSP(National Service Provider)


If the local IPS knows the IP address then it will sends the request to the desired network but if it does not know the IP then it will send it to the regional ISP and then to NSP
