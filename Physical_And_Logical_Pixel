 Physical Pixel (Device Pixel)
The actual tiny dots that make up the screen.

These are hardware-level pixels.

The more physical pixels you have, the higher the screen resolution.

For example, a phone might have a screen of 1080x1920 physical pixels.

ðŸ”£ Logical Pixel (CSS Pixel or Device-Independent Pixel)
A virtual pixel used by the operating system and browsers for layout.

Itâ€™s the unit you typically work with in CSS.

A logical pixel can represent multiple physical pixels, depending on the screenâ€™s pixel density.

ðŸ“± Why the Difference?
Because of high-DPI (high-resolution) displays like Retina screens, physical pixels are too small to use 1:1 for web layout. To make UI elements readable and consistent across devices:

Browsers scale the layout using logical pixels.

This scaling is controlled by the device pixel ratio (DPR).
