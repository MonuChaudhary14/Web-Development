    <!--
    Post request is given when we have to give a lot of data
    Get request is given when we have to give simple information to the server. There is limit in this

    When we use get, the information is sent into the server and it is shown in the url

    Data is sent in the URL (as query parameters).

Example:

<form method="GET" action="/search">

Submitting this might result in:

/search?query=shoes&color=blue

Not good for sensitive data and large amount of data as the URL is limited



Post->
Data is sent in the request body, not visible in the URL

Login forms

Contact forms   

Submitting data that changes server state (like adding to a database)

Can't bookmark or easily share the form data (which is usually a good thing for privacy!

    -->
