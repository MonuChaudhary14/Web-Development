A tag is a keyword enclosed in angle brackets (< >) that tells the browser how to structure and display content

Tag is a markup entity



Types of Tags

1. Semantics Tags->
Semantic tags are HTML tags that clearly describe their meaning both to the browser and the developer.

Instead of just using a <div> for everything (which says nothing about its content), semantic tags like <header>, <nav>, or <article> tell you what the content is.

<header>	Top section of a page or section (like a title/logo)
<nav>	Navigation links (menus, sidebars)
<main>	Main content area (only one per page)
<article>	Self-contained piece of content (blog post, news)
<section>	Thematic grouping of content
<aside>	Content that's related but not part of the main flow (like a sidebar or ads)
<footer>	Bottom of a page or section (contact info, links)
<figure>	Wraps images, diagrams, etc., with optional captions
<figcaption>	Caption for the <figure>
<time>


2.Structure Tags->
In HTML5, structure tags (also called semantic structure tags) are used to define the layout and sections of a webpage in a meaningful way.

These tags give both browsers and developers a better understanding of what each part of the page does.


<html>	Root element of the HTML document
<head>	Metadata: title, styles, scripts, charset, viewport, etc.
<body>	Contains all visible page content
<header>	Intro section for a page or section (can include logo, nav, title, etc.)
<nav>	Navigation links (menus, links to other pages)
<main>	Main content of the page (unique and central content)
<section>	Groups related content (like chapters or topics)
<article>	Independent, self-contained content (like blog posts, news items)
<aside>	Side content (ads, tips, sidebars, extra links)
<footer>	Bottom section of a page/section (copyright, contact info, links)



3. Formatting Tags->
These tags are used to style or highlight text and content to make it more readable or meaningful.

<b>	Bold text (no extra importance)	<b>Bold</b> → Bold
<strong>	Strong importance (usually bold)	<strong>Important</strong> → Important
<i>	Italic text (no extra importance)	<i>Italic</i> → Italic
<em>	Emphasized text (usually italic)	<em>Emphasized</em> → Emphasized
<mark>	Highlighted text (usually yellow background)	<mark>Highlight</mark> → <mark>Highlight</mark>
<small>	Smaller text	<small>Note</small> → <small>Note</small>
<sub>	Subscript text (below the line)	H<sub>2</sub>O → H<sub>2</sub>O
<sup>	Superscript text (above the line)	x<sup>2</sup> → x<sup>2</sup>
<del>	Deleted (strikethrough) text	<del>Old</del> → <del>Old</del>
<ins>	Inserted (underlined) text	<ins>New</ins> → <ins>New</ins>
<code>	Displays code in monospace font	<code>console.log()</code> → <code>console.log()</code>
<pre>	Preserves spacing and line breaks (preformatted)	Used with <code> a lot
<blockquote>	For quoting long passages	Indented quote block
<q>	Short inline quote	<q>quoted</q> → “quoted
