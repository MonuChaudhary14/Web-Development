    <!--Id is the attribute of a element which is unique 
    Class is also an attribute of an element 
    
    An element can have multiple classes but id must be one and unique
    Same class can be given to multiple elements
    When we want to give multiple classes then we give space


    We can give the class in CSS file to modify the class by using .name_of_class
    Ex-  .red{    }

    We can also give id in CSS file to modify the element by using #id
    Ex- #First{    }


    Id is also used in linking.
    When we use #id in the URL then it will open the file and move the page to the particular id
    
    -->

    <div id="First" class="red bg-yellow"> First</div>

    <span id="second" class="red"> Second</span>
